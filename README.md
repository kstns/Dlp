Predicting stock prices with deep learning (RNN)

This project aims to predict next day stock price based on the previous stock price information. 
RNN model will be used for this task.
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are different from other neural networks in that each neuron also utilizes its output 
from previous iteration.
This allows the model to "remember" its previous state and use it in predicting. As a result RNN are known to be very 
good at time series or sequence prediction problems such as translations, speech recognition, etc.

I will be using Keras library which is built on top of TensorFlow and allows to easily create artificial neural networks: https://keras.io/
